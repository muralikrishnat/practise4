            <p data-v-61695892="">When we decided to begin manufacturing in the United States, we were confident of success.
                There’s a growing demand for Kia cars and CUVs, and we wanted to better serve that need, but you have to
                do more than that to succeed. You need to surround yourself with quality people. Like the folks at our Georgia
                facility.

            <p data-v-61695892="">We believe we’re building more than great cars in the U.S.—because we are. Kia Motors Manufacturing
                Georgia continues to be a significant growth enabler for the West Point community and the Kia brand. The
                plant operates three shifts and is responsible for the creation of more than 15,000 jobs (plant and suppliers).
                More than 40 percent of Kia’s vehicles, the Optima and Sorento, are built in West Point. The factory opened
                with consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla ut diam tortor. Suspendisse ac nulla ut lacus laoreet aliquam a nec
                nibh. Donec lacinia nunc sit amet varius scelerisque.</p>

                to the Kia family. If you visit this part of Georgia, you’ll quickly realize that there’s a lot more than
                great cars being built here. What’s sprung up over the past few years is a rebirth of sorts. Thanks to the
                vision and can-do attitude of folks here in West Point, Georgia, a community is flourishing and a classic
                American success story is in the making.</p> <span data-v-61695892=""> <div style="display: none;">
